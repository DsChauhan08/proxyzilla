# This is BingVault Proxy Server

Welcome to the BingVault Proxy Server repository! This server plays a crucial role in providing a seamless and secure streaming experience for BingVault, ensuring a smooth connection between users and content sources.

## Overview

The BingVault Proxy Server handles requests and responses, acting as an intermediary between the user's device and the external content sources. This ensures that your streaming experience is both efficient and secure.


## How It Works

The BingVault Proxy is used to bypass CORS-protected URLs on the client side, allowing users to make requests to CORS protected endpoints without a backend server.

## Getting Started

You have to use Cloudflare Workers to run this. Also having a github account it must.
